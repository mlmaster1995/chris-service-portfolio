## About The Portfolio
This is a **FUN** place for me to create, test, present all my passions for the software engineering. During the school time, I created multiple projects including AI, ML, Big Data Analytics which made a solid foundation to bring me into a real career as a software engineer focuing on the backend. Unfortunately, I missed the chance to demonstrate my growth due to the daily busy work in the past. Now, I decide to rollout this portfolio to show where I am now, what I could do and also where I will develop my future towards to. I will continue to update this portfolio to show my current skill capability, or a new skill/tech aqcuired or a new idea poping up.  

Please check my new projects and feedback to me. Happy Coding! Cheers~~
