## About The Project
This is a Jeknins pipeline setup to automate the process of project test & build & deploy for all the backend service in this portfolio. All the ```backend services``` I created will use this pipeline to run end-to-end test in the personal free-tire aws account, typically in ```AWS EKS```. This is a ```live and ongoing``` project including both ```manual commands``` and ```python script``` for automation. On top of the Jenkins pipline, it also includes all setup for ```k8s``` environment. I will continously contribute to this repo, and demonestrate my skills and capability in backend.
